# HANGMAN
For my Milestone Project #3 on Code Institute's Diploma in Software Developement course I have created a Hangman Python game.
The game selects a random word from a list with 55 animal names and starts showing an empty hangman and blank spaces corresponding with each letter in the word that needs to be guessed. 
The game finishes when all the letters are guessed correctly or if the hangman is completed, leaving the user out of moves to play.

## Features

- Hangman is build as user makes wrong guesses.
- Console tells user if the guessed letter is right or wrong.
- List of all guessed letters is shown.
- If the user types something else than a letter, console shows an error message.
- The word to be guessed is shown as dashes so the user knows how many letters the word contains.
